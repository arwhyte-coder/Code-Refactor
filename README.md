# Home-Work-Week-1

# HTML notes
cleaned up the html file by changing div tags to section tags

added alt attribute to images

removed header class and changed div to header

removed footer class and changed div to footer

removed div and changed to nav for navigation - wanted to make this change to a drop down menu when viewing on a smaller device, wasn't able to do this. Will keep googling and youtubing

added a class to some of the p tags for smaller screens

# CSS notes
comments are in my css file 

I didn't like how the images went when I added the media tag in so I made them hidden when you get to a smaller screen - would love some comments on this if possible? I googled and youtubed but couldn't seem to get it to work. This is also why I didn't add a smaller screen size in. 

consolidated a few of the tags 

Overall I am happy with the website, however I believe I need to do some more self study on device screen accessibility
